# urban-flood-risk-indicator-cokriging

This repository contains R code and data for a synthetic experiment on enhancing street-level urban flood risk information by combining observations with physical modeling using indicator cokriging. 
This repository accompanies the paper [**Enhancing street-level urban flood risk information combining observations with physical modeling using indicator cokriging: a synthetic experiment**] (in review) (Hyeonjin Choi, Minyoung Kim, Bomi Kim, Junyeong Kum, Haeseong Lee, Myungho Lee, Seong Jin Noh ) and managed by the Hydrology and Water Resources Lab (Noh Lab, https://cyber-hydrology.github.io/) at Kumoh National Institute of Technology.

In this repository, we provide
* Demo & Training code (code)
* Datasets we used (data)

## Project Overview
Urban flooding poses significant challenges in densely populated areas. This project aims to improve flood risk assessments by integrating multi point-based observation data with physics-based flood model through indicator cokriging techniques.

## Features
* Indicator Cokriging Implementation: Utilizes the gstat package for geostatistical modeling.
* Synthetic Data Generation: Creates synthetic datasets to simulate urban flood scenarios.
* Visualization Tools: Provides scripts for visualizing flood risk maps and model outputs.
